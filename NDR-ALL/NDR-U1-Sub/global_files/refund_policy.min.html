<b>Refund Policy</u></b>
</p>
<p>
At New Day Rising, our customers’ satisfaction is our top priority, which is why we offer a 180-day, money back guarantee. If at any point you decide it’s not the right product for you, remember you are protected by the highest standard 100% money-back guarantee. Just send us the empty bottle(s) and we’ll refund you to the last penny, no questions asked. Here’s exactly what to do:
<br/><br/>
Contact the SB Support team via email info@ndronline.us or via the Contact Us web form.
<br/><br/>
Please provide the following information: First Name, Last Name, Email and Phone used to place the order, Shipping Address, Shipping City, State, and Zip code, Order Number, Items that you wish to return, and quantity of items.
<br/><br/>
You will receive a reply within 24-48 business hours Monday through Friday between the hours of 10:00 am and 7:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. We will gladly provide you with our return address. This is an easy and effortless process.
<br/><br/>
Return the empty canister, along with the original order invoice that you received, and the confirmation number you have been assigned.
<br/><br/>
It is your obligation to pay the return postage, and we do recommend you opt for tracking and confirmation numbers for verification and efficiency purposes. Note: We must receive the canister within 180 days from the date of original purchase for the refund to be valid.
<br/><br/>
We will refund your entire order, excluding shipping costs, as long as all bottles purchased are returned. Return address is NDR Online, 1968 S. Coast Hwy #3154 Laguna Beach CA 92651. These guidelines were created to keep you satisfied, while at the same time ensuring we can continue to provide a quality product to other happy customers for years to come. Returning any New Day Rising Supplement without complying with our policy will, unfortunately, deem your transaction non-refundable.
<br/><br/>
After complying with the steps above, please allow adequate time for shipping, quality control, and communication with credit card companies and banks as you patiently await your refund.
